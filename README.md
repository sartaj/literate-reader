# Literate Reader

As much as people write code, they should also read code.

Currently reading code involves either reading source code or going through web docs. This extension aims to solve that by allowing source code to be 'viewed' in a reader mode. All this does is convert your JavaScript to a markdown document.

## How to Use

From the command palette, run "Read in Literate Mode". Or use the shortcut `shift+ctrl+l` or `shift+cmd+l`.

Currently, this extension only works with JavaScript.

## Features

* Preview anything in markdown or GFM (tables, images, lists, etc)
